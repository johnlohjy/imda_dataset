The conversational data, which includes the audio and accompanying transcripts, in Part 3 were collected from speakers who were speaking to each other in pairs.

Some speakers were given extracts from card games, and picture games to play to elicit more natural conversation.

IMDA acknowledges that the following games were used:
1.            Smol talk – www.starknicked.com
2.            Hypothetically Fun - http://www.hypotheticallyfun.com/
3.            Baker, R., & Hazan, V. (2011). DiapixUK: task materials for the elicitation of multiple spontaneous speech dialogs. Behavior research methods, 43(3), 761-770.

Speakers were advised not to divulge private information about themselves or others, as well as to avoid sensitive topics and conversations, by referencing the local radio broadcast guidelines. Any sentiments and opinions that may have been expressed by the speakers remain their own, and do not represent the view of IMDA. IMDA is not responsible for the accuracy/truth any of the statements made by the speakers.
